Wordpress-to-placehold.it
=========================

This is a drop-in file. There is no need for installation!

### Usage:
* Upload the file replacer.php (via FTP) to your wordpress root directory (where wp-content, wp-includes and wp-admin are).
2. Access it via web browser (example.com/replacer.php)
3. Pick a Wordpress export file with the presented HTML form.
4. Click submit
5. Wait till the process is over (Some stats will appear)
6. Use the download link to download your new file.

That is it. The newly downloaded file is ready to be imported in new location. 

PLEASE TEST THE NEWLY IMPORTED CONTENT WELL
